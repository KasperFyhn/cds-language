# Language Analytics - Spring 2025

This repository contains all of the code and data related to the Spring 2025 module _Language Analytics_ as part of the bachelor's elective in [Cultural Data Science](https://bachelor.au.dk/en/supplementary-subject/culturaldatascience/) at Aarhus University. It is a fork of Ross Deans Kristensen-McLachlan's repository for previous years of the course.

The repository is in active development, with new material being pushed on a weekly basis.
